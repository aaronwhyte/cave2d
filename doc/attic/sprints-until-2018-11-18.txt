  No I messed it up, and decided it wasn't worthwhile. It's good enough.

Player movement
x use mouse trackball
x limit max accel, like game2
x stun when hitting things hard, to prevent super-strong pushing. Lowers max accel more.
v floaty garbage because I love it!!

Scanner: Vision and target-finding
* Scans for unobstructed targets
* Can lock on to targets to track them more aggressively
* Knows last time target was seen, pos, and velocity.
* This is all great but it is separate from movement
v always do random scan, track random scan separately from locked scan
v client decides what to lock to. Add setLockedSpiritId(id) and breakLock()
v if now - lastLockedTargetSeenTime > maxBrokenLockDuration then break lock
v if lock unbroken

  v ant locks target
  v ant turns towards locked target
  v ant follows target around corners
    v move to target last pos
    x rotate to target last velocity
    v start search fresh
  v ant loses interest if it cannot find target after a while
  x ant loses interest if it sees target destroyed

      v obstruction distance
      v obstruction path ID (to get body ID or spirit ID etc)
  v params:

    v apply to laser for sure
    v warm-up graphics for laser - throbbing red light?
  v fix laser warmup graphics to use regular circle model draw, not a ton of overlapping splashes, or make splashes count
  x melee weapon for player. What'll it be? Daggers? A Mace? No! A orbit-y rock thingy!
  x player use of melee weapons aided by target scanner
    x when the weapon is ready
      x activate TargetScanner that matches weapon range/shape
      x add TargetScanner onLock callback that the player can use to fire melee weapon?
    x player doesn't kill on contact
  x non-fatal hit:
    x stun
    x N-frame white flash (need to handle render-time biz like that, not in world-time)
    x force applies to attacker and defender, but mostly defender
  x fatal hit
    x changes spirit to corpse, with lots of knockback
    x corpse turns to dust easily


We're changing gears!
* New design: Dandy meets Gridrunner meets Legend of Dungeon.
* Players have inventory.
* Touch item to collect
* primary, secondary, drop
* select from inventory, like OS task switcher
* all items have drawable icon

ITEMS
Hm. Some tools, like clearPathScanner, are not items.
And some items, like a health powerup, are not tools.
Plus, some items might have multiple aspects, even multiple tool modes.
All Items will have an icon, and be renderable as world objects or inventory objects.
Some types of items:
* Collectible, stackable one-shots, like Dandy's health and bombs
* In-inventory, but not droppable, like "empty-handed" or Gungeon-like starter-weapon. Maybe "settings"?
* Consume-on-touch, like power-ups. Maybe these won't exist, but I do like classic power-ups.
* If a tool-like item has a cool-down, dropping and picking it up again must not reset the cool-down, so
  the inner Tool aspect should live with the Item, and not be re-created.

Item class
v icon
v short text
v properties
  v isDroppable()
  v getButtonCount() returns 0, 1, or 2 for now
  v getButtonIcon(index)
v interaction callbacks
  v onPickup()
  v onDrop()
  v onSelect()
  v onUnselect()
  v onButtonDown(index)
  v onButtonUp(index)

Inventory
v Data structure
  v fairly short ordered list (array) of items. 0th is the one the player is holding.
  v remove(index) shuffles the rest over. Usually remove(0) but thieves or special attacks could cause other drops
  v select(index) pulls that one up to 0 and shuffles affected items to the right
  v add(item, index) pushes things to the right

Collectible Item spirits
v BaseItemSpirit has common code and some params for concrete child classes
  v Concrete child classes have their own editor-friendly ids and things.
  v But because the classes are so small, cram them all into one file, items.js

x Renders with a bubble(?) and the item icon, but they're a single stamp? try it.
v Only players can interact with items for now. That'll be pretty action-game normal.
v Document how to add items, because there are a lot of steps.

Inventory Management UX part 1
v touch in-world item to add it to inventry position 0
  v ItemSpirits actually have Items in them
    v SlowShooter
    v MediumShooter
    v LaserWeapon
  v PlayerSpirit collision code knows what to do with Item collisions
    v PlayerSpirit has Inventory
    v Item is extracted
    v old selection us unselected
    v Spirit is destroyed
v button layout (create 'em all but hook them up to dummy down/up listeners)
  v primary action
  v secondary action
  v equip
  v drop
v drop item
  v button hookup
  v on down, start drop/throw targetting pseudomode
  v on up, actually drop/throw
  v creates appropriate Spirit
v player drops everything when they die
v replace PlayerSpirit.weapon with PlayerSpirit.item.tool

Item Simplification
Now there are about 3 layers per item: ItemSpirit, Item, Tool (which is also a Spirit)
But a single Spirit can do those jobs:
* be a thing in the world with your own body and rendering and friction etc
  * use world timeouts for friction
  * draw self
* remove your worldly body when entering inventory, and restore it when leaving, into the world
* be a selected item with tool capabilities
  * use the wielder's body and direction to decide where to fire from etc.
  * use timers to manage fire cool-down time etc
* be an unselected item in an Inventory list
  * do not draw when asked to (usually but this could be neat for special items)
  * continue to use world timeouts as you see fit, but probably be passive
---
There are two classes of Tools today:
1) Those that gets wrapped in Items and ItemSpirits
2) Those that do not, like ClearPathScanner and TargetScanner
They're all Spirits.
The latter two are not part of inventory and do not get dropped. They're always wielded.
Tools from (1) have three modes:
1.1) Wielded. This is the same as (2).
1.2) Wrapped in a spirit that has its own body, a free world object
1.3) In inventory, neither weilded nor a free world object.
---
All the serious code is in the "tools" dir. What else gets added by upper layers today?
"BaseItem" adds basically no value.
The ItemSpirits have a body-maker, and friction values and other super-simple things.
Let's use the tersely-named Tool classes and just add stuff like body, friction, modelId.

v port the remaining items
  v slow shooter

v Active/Passive loop
  v Stop active/passive timeout loop if disembodied.
  v Start it when embodied.

v when player dies, throw inventory around semi-randomly
v tighten player angular rotation using dampened spring biz

v only show one action button for now
v hide inventory button too

v rework keyboard aiming

v rework controls so that quick taps are never lost.
  v ControlMap hold array of events
    v ControlEvent class
      v controlName (from map)
      v eventType: triggerDown (bool), stickTouched (bool), stickMove (vec)
      v boolean b
      v vec2d vec
  v as controls are added to map, map adds callback to controls
  v as js event handlers fire, controls enqueue events through controlmap callback
  x controlmap calls poll() on controls that support it, before giving controls to player
(Did this for triggers but not sticks. Good enough for now.)

v MineSpirit is different...
  v model: orb with eight? little spikes
  v Detonates on contact with anything, including player
    v adjust NEUTRAL
  v Produces a bunch of breaker bullets that are on a team
    x BreakerBulletSpirit // used regular bullet! So flexible.
  v Also detonates after a time. Does beep-beep-beep thing and blinks.
    v Set health to 1, and explode instantly if killed
    v But if gently touched, animate (spin?) and make a noise and set a timeout for boom-town.
  v make mines a proper level prop.

Data management idea
Scalable, Flexible, Simple: Pick Two
There's a lot of data that's embedded in code in various places.
A spirit has a MenuItemName string, SpiritType string, modelId, constructor, maybe item type and item constructor...
A lot of the code is just creating mappings from one thing to the other, which is basically database indexing
Maybe I should have an actual single JSON table, sort of like what I have for SpiritConfig but more declarative.
Or maybe each kind of thing should have a single KeyName that is used in lots of other tables:
spiritConfig
itemConfig?
iconModelId
v do it

  v tractor-beam tool, for encapsulation and re-usabilitiy
  v player has one that only works when they're empty-handed
  v sound
v B: shield?
  v game2 graphics - gross!
  v game2 sound, but duration and volume proportional to recent damage taken plus collisions
  v needs drawback so you don't hold it down constantly
    x makes a loud noise that attracts enemies?
    v lowers traction?
    v makes you bouncy? Kind of a good thing too sometimes, some prop interaction! YES.
    v Only absorbs XX% of damage plus some inconvenient thing?
    x prevents healing?
  v it absorbs damage and sheds it at like 10%/frame
    v but you can release that early
      x and it bursts out as slightly damaging particles?
      v Or a turbo-boost?
  v can't pick up items while it is activated
  v can't tractor-beam either

<BUG BREAK>
v fix persistent-sound bugs
  v bug: wubs continue when paused
  v bug: wubs go forever after exiting level
v retain mouse lock across levels
v fix weird locking when clocking the pause menu background on a level other than the first
v break pointer lock on victory pages
</BUG BREAK>

v make shield more effective by instantly switching it on when dropping stuff.

life management?
v No visible player health? That's kinda bullshit tho.
v shield absorbs 100% damage
v one hit kills player
v Make shield shatter when faded shield damage maxes out, killing player and maybe throwing energy around.
v nonfatal damage still needs grx and sound tho
v heal towards max HP when partially damaged
v OK 1.1 hits kills player.

NOTES
Weapons that are good for the enemies are not good for the player and vice versa.
Player reflexes are slow but player shots should be fast.
Enemy computer reflexes are instant but enemies should project and slow their attacks so player can evade.
Player weapons should auto-aim a bit more than they do, or precise aim should be less of a concern.
Player is smart enough to use interesting weapons, but enemies not so much?
Shield is not that much fun but might make an interesting item to activate.
Make empty drop do repulsor pulse, more like game4? That was a winner.
Make pain provide turbo directly, not shield?

End game5, begin game6! Everything below here was slated for Game5 but then I was all like "ship it!",
so this stuff, if it happens, will happen in a later game. There's so much of it! And none of it
actually covers the main complaints from strangers who commented, which amount to "what are the rules"
and "what are the controls". And one "How do I get rid of player 2?"
I think the playthough video probably helped, but I need to address those issues next.

- touch sense for enemies - turn to face source of damage, if not target locked

hearing sense for enemies
* Sounds are instantaneous.
* Critters process all the sounds they heard since the last time they heard sounds
- SoundHistory class, with one instance per world
  - backed by circular buffer big enough that we avoid dropping sounds. Big is fine.
  - records are SoundEntry objs, pre-allocated to fill buffer
    - type - what sound was it? Used for prioritization among sounds when picking things to react to.
    - position
    - time
    - loudness
    - soundId - unique identifier
      - SoundHistory nextId starts at 1 and goes up by one each time
- Hearing module for "hunting" spirits
  - Spirit remembers processedSoundId, for the last soundId they processed. This only goes up.
  - spirit states, for making sense of hearing sense:
    - passive, ignoring sounds
    - active
      - searching, using sound to pick a distination location
      - target locked, so maybe ignoring sounds unless they're very high priority
  - when just becoming active, ignore prev sounds
  - when bored, process unprocessed global ones in order
    - first filter by dist and loudness. Could the critter have heard it?
    - then, for winner-takes-all, take higest score: priority(type) * timeToTarget(which is distance / speed))
  - There's an idea of "remembered sound", like one that is being searched for. It's priority score fades with age.
  - copy the fields for the winner
   - head towards the winning sound until its score is 0 or until it is forgotton?
  - if a target is seen, that clears the hearing record

- weapon graphics overhaul
  - weapon sights identify weapon, not overdraw on body
    - slow shooter
    - medium (rename to bouncy)
    - laser

- persistent-effect weapons
  - ice
    - effects - frozen, no traction, some friction, ok elasticity, no action, shots cancelled
    - graphics - ice colored, frost aura
    - frozen-ness accounting and recovery speed
    - shatter effect when killed while frozen
    - heat attacks melt ice instead of doing damage
  - slime
    - effects - low traction, some friction, low elasticity
    - graphics - green aura, sheds globules that actually bounce once
    - slimed-ness accounting and recovery
    - bumping something transfers slime to it based on magnitude up to 1/4.
  - combined ice and slime
    - combined grx is green ice
    - combined effect is same as ice until ice melts
    - ice stops slime recovery
    - iced slime does not transfer on collision
    - greener shatter effect when killed while frozen & slimed

- new weapons
  - melee

Emotions on player faces? I would like that.


- Encapsulate behavior: WallAvoidance
  - uses ClearPathScanner
  - moving in a given direction
    - angular friction
    - linear friction
    - turn towards direction
    - and thrust (proportional to direction alignment + constant)
  - stress?
    - influencers
      - obstructions increase stress
      - clear path or target-visible clears stress
    - effects
      - 100% stress means lots of obstruction, maybe trapped. Subtle state change:
        - clear-path side-sweep scan count = 0
        - should also stop scanner I guess
        - randomly freak out instead since plans didn't work.
      - if unstressed, wanderers turn randomly
      - stress decreases thrust, to avoid ramming into walls

- target-intercept behavior, like tractor beam
  - search for target
    - random search (or structured sweep?)
    - compare candidate target with current target if any.
  - target chosen
    - scan to target
    - move to intercept
      - choose along vector of where target is (0) and where intercept point is (1)
        - pull out intercept code for Avoidance
      - adjust vel to target vel or whatever
- target-avoidance
  - same as intercept, but adjust vel away from target vel?
- Also do diff between "hit target hard" and "come to rest at dist D from target", mjolnir-style

Impl concepts:
- desired distance
  - negative infinity: ram target hard
  - small negative number: gently push target
  - 0: rest just barely touching target
  - small positive num: follow target w/o touching
  - positive infinity: get away from the target!
- lead/follow
  - try to get to where target will be in f(positions and vels) time
    - zero:  dumbly go to where target is now.
    - positive but proportional to... dist?: lead the target
    - if negative, try to get to where target would have come from - go behind target

Containers can be assigned items from editor
* Cannot be a surprise when you run the level. Needs to be a real obvious editor thing.
* Explicitly pick up item (not container?) and hold it over container.
* On-hover cue lets you know something can happen there.
* When it happens, it's an explicit state change.
  * Needs undo/redo support
* Needs opposite gesture, to remove an item from a container
  * don'ts:
    * grab-n-drag is probably not right, because it makes dragging containers hard
    * I hate long-press
  * How about a tap of the current "drag" button opens a details pane on the highlighted item?
    That opens up tons of possibilities! Dropping inventory, tweaking stats, flipping bits, getting deets.
* Congrats you reinvented crafting.
